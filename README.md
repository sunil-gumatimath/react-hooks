# React Hooks Project

This project was created to explore and demonstrate various React Hooks. It is built using React and Vite.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo (if you have a remote repository)
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or a similar port) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint`

Lints the project files using ESLint to identify and fix stylistic and code quality issues.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build from the `dist` folder locally. This is useful for verifying the final build before deployment.

## Examples

This project includes the following examples of React Hooks:

### useState

*   **Car Example:** A simple example demonstrating how to use `useState` to manage a car's state (e.g., color, year, make).
*   **Color Changer:** A component that changes its color on button click, showcasing `useState` for managing color state.
*   **Counter:** A basic counter that increments and decrements, illustrating the use of `useState` for numerical state.
